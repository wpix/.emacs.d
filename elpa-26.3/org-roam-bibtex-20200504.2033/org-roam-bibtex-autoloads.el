(autoload 'orb-edit-notes "org-roam-bibtex" "\
Open an Org-roam note associated with the CITEKEY or create a new one.

This function allows to use Org-roam as a backend for managing
bibliography notes.  It relies on `bibtex-completion' to get
retrieve bibliographic information from a BibTeX file.

Implementation details and features:

1. This function first calls `org-roam-find-ref' trying to find
the note file associated with the CITEKEY.  The Org-roam key can
be set with '#+ROAM_KEY:' in-buffer keyword.

2. If the Org-roam reference has not been found, the function
calls `org-roam-find-file' passing to it the title associated
with the CITEKEY as retrieved by `bibtex-completion-get-entry'.
The prompt presented by `org-roam-find-file' will thus be
pre-populated with the record title.

3. The template used to create the note is stored in
`orb-templates'.  If the variable is not defined, revert to using
`org-roam-capture-templates'.  In the former case, a new file
will be created and filled according to the template, possibly
preformatted (see below) without additional user interaction.  In
the latter case, an interactive `org-capture' process will be
run.

4. Optionally, when `orb-preformat-templates' is non-nil, any
prompt wildcards in `orb-templates' or
`org-roam-capture-templates' associated with the bibtex record
fields as specified in `orb-preformat-templates' will be
preformatted.  Both `org-capture-templates' (%^{}) and
`org-roam-capture-templates' (`s-format', ${}) prompt syntaxes
are supported.

See `orb-preformat-keywords' for more details on how
to properly specify prompts for replacement.

Please pay attention when using this feature that by setting
title for preformatting it will be impossible to change it in the
`org-roam-find-file' interactive prompt since all the template
expansions will have taken place by then.  All the title
wildcards will be replace with the BibTeX field value.

5. Optionally, if you are using Projectile and Persp-mode and
have a dedicated workspace to work with your Org-roam collection,
you may want to set the perspective name and project path in
`orb-persp-project' and `orb-switch-persp' to t.  In this case,
the perspective will be switched to the Org-roam notes project
before calling any Org-roam functions.
